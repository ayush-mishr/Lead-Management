/**
 * USER ISOLATION TEST GUIDE
 * 
 * Follow these steps to test if user isolation is working:
 */

// 1. SIGN UP TEST
console.log("=== USER ISOLATION TEST ===");

// Step 1: Sign up with User A
const userA = {
  firstName: "Alice",
  lastName: "Smith", 
  email: "alice@test.com",
  password: "password123"
};

// Step 2: Sign up with User B  
const userB = {
  firstName: "Bob",
  lastName: "Jones",
  email: "bob@test.com", 
  password: "password123"
};

// 2. LEAD CREATION TEST
// User A creates leads:
const userALeads = [
  { name: "Alice Lead 1", email: "lead1@alice.com" },
  { name: "Alice Lead 2", email: "lead2@alice.com" }
];

// User B creates leads:
const userBLeads = [
  { name: "Bob Lead 1", email: "lead1@bob.com" },
  { name: "Bob Lead 2", email: "lead2@bob.com" }
];

// 3. ISOLATION VERIFICATION
// ✅ EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
// - User A should ONLY see Alice Lead 1 & Alice Lead 2
// - User B should ONLY see Bob Lead 1 & Bob Lead 2
// - Neither user should see the other's leads

// ❌ CURRENT PROBLEM (if isolation fails):
// - Both users see all 4 leads
// - Users see each other's private data

/**
 * RENDER DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST:
 * 
 * 1. ✅ Check Render logs for deployment errors
 * 2. ✅ Verify environment variables are set
 * 3. ✅ Ensure MongoDB connection works
 * 4. ✅ Check JWT_SECRET is configured
 * 5. ✅ Verify latest code is deployed
 * 6. ✅ Test API endpoints manually
 * 7. ✅ Check browser console for errors
 * 8. ✅ Verify authentication headers are sent
 */

/**
 * DEBUGGING STEPS FOR RENDER:
 * 
 * 1. Check Render Dashboard > Logs
 * 2. Look for authentication middleware logs
 * 3. Verify JWT token verification works  
 * 4. Check database queries include user filter
 * 5. Test API endpoints with Postman/curl
